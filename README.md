# Student Management System (Starter)

This repository contains a minimal, front-end starter for a Student Management System.

Structure
- `assets/` — CSS, JS, images, fonts
- `pages/` — HTML pages (login, dashboard, students, courses, attendance, grades, reports)
- `components/` — small reusable HTML snippets (navbar, sidebar, footer)
- `data/` — sample data (`sample.json`)

Quick start
1. Open `pages/index.html` in your browser (or serve the folder with a static server).

Notes
- This is a static starter: auth and data use `sessionStorage`/`localStorage` for demo purposes only.
- Integrate with a backend API for production use.

If you want, I can:
- Add a small Node static server and `package.json` to serve the site
- Implement a simple API with Express + lowdb for persistent storage
- Wire up a prettier UI and components
